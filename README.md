## Introduction

We are a group of concerned volunteers  from all over the world that have spontaneously gathered together to translate reports in Chinese media on the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia outbreak. By translating first-hand reports from inside the affected areas in China, we aim to offer a panoramic view of the epidemic to the global community.

## Inclusion Criteria

We selectively included news reports from reputable and reliable news agencies and WeChat official accounts that are characterized by their careful research, nuanced presentation, or novel perspectives, especially the descriptive reports coming from the frontline and the grassroots (including all areas, populations, and industries, not limited only to the most publicized ones). In the selected articles, the authors are not the narrators or the interviewees themselves.
